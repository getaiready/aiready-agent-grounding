## Available Skills

### aiready-best-practices

Guidelines for writing AI-friendly code. Use when:

- Writing new features or refactoring
- Reviewing pull requests
- Preparing codebases for AI adoption

## 🚀 Managed Evolution (The Empire Strategy)

AIReady skills are the procedural backbone of our three-layer ecosystem:

1.  **Open Source (OSS)**: Use these skills locally with `@aiready/cli` and `mcp-server`.
2.  **Platform Activation**: Upload your readiness scores to the [AIReady Dashboard](https://getaiready.dev/dashboard) to track trends and team progress.
3.  **ClawMore Evolution**: Upgrade to [ClawMore](https://getaiready.dev/clawmore) for autonomous codebase evolution and managed infrastructure.

**From Scan → Monitor → Evolve.**
